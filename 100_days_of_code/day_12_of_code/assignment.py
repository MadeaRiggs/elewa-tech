# 1) Write a python Program to prompt the user to create a shopping list and calculate the total cost
# milk= int(input("Milk packets are "))
# flour= int(input("Flour packets are "))
# oil= int(input("Cooking oil bottles are "))

# milk_cost= float(input("The cost of milk is "))
# flour_cost= float(input("The cost of flour is "))
# oil_cost= float(input("The cost of oil is "))

# total_cost= (milk * milk_cost) + (flour * flour_cost) + (oil * oil_cost)
# print("The total shopping cost is ", total_cost)


# 2) Write a python program that will prompt the user to perform the calculations of Area, surface area and volume of a cuboid
# length = float(input("length is "))
# width = float(input("width is "))
# height = float(input("height is "))

# # Calculate and display the results
# area = length * width
# print("Area of cuboid is ", area)

# surface_area = (2 *length * width) + (2 *length * height) + (2 * height * width)
# print("Surface area of cuboid is ", surface_area)

# volume = length * width * height
# print("Volume of cuboid is ", volume)


# 3) Write a python program that will prompt the user to input their credit card information and check whether the information shared is a string or an integer
